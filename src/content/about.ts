  introText: `I’m a lifelong learner and empathetic engineering leader passionate
          about leveraging technology in collaboration with my team to deliver
          software that solves problems and makes an impact. I’ve spent a decade
          in engineering management roles, building environments where engineers
          feel safe to grow, challenge themselves, and do meaningful work.`,
  approachHeading: "My Approach to Leadership",
  approachText1: `I lead with integrity, empathy, and transparency. Whether I’m shaping
          processes, partnering with cross-functional teams, coaching engineers,
          or contributing directly to technical conversations, I focus on
          building trust and delivering impact.`,
  approachText2: `My passion lies in helping engineering organizations improve their
          health, grow sustainably, and align engineering efforts with broader
          business goals. I believe great teams are built on strong
          relationships, clear communication, and a shared sense of purpose.`,
  journeyHeading: "My Journey So Far",
  journeyText1: `I've led teams in both large enterprise environments and fast-moving
          startups. I’ve managed engineers from entry-level through staff, and
          I’ve spent several years managing managers.`,
  journeyText2: `My teams have built and shipped high-quality software products
          leveraging technologies such as Java, JavaScript, React, Ruby,
          TypeScript, Python, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and AWS. Whatever the tech
          stack, I bring the ability to learn quickly, solve real-world
          problems, improve engineering efficiency and effectiveness, and
          support engineers in doing their best work.`,
  workingWithMeHeading: "Working With Me",
  workingWithMeText1: `I’m approachable, calm under pressure, and passionate about making
          work a place where people can grow and take pride in what they build.
          I encourage healthy debate, value psychological safety, and default to
          kindness.`,
  workingWithMeText2: `My management philosophy is best described as "trust, but verify". By
          default, I trust my team to show up, do their best work, and
          communicate proactively and transparently about any issues that may
          arise. As a leader with accountability for my teams' deliverables,
          I'll also perform my due diligence in ensuring we're on track to meet
          our goals, but do so WITHOUT getting in the way or micromanaging
          tasks.`,
  workingWithMeText3: `I collaborate respectfully and successfully with Product, Design,
          Data, Marketing, Success/Support, and exec partners to ensure
          Engineering is aligned and driving the business forward. I'm
          comfortable influencing across the org while still rolling up my
          sleeves when needed.`,
  nextChapterHeading: "My Next Chapter",

          organization succeed and scale: operationally, technically,
          culturally, and financially. I want to work on products that matter,
          alongside people who care about each other and the work they do.`,
