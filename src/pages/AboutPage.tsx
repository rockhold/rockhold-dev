        <p className="text-zinc-200">
          I've led teams in both large enterprise environments and fast-moving
          startups. I‚Äôve managed engineers from entry-level through staff, and
          I‚Äôve spent several years managing managers.

        <p className="text-zinc-200 mt-4">
          My teams have built and shipped high-quality software products
          leveraging technologies like Java, JavaScript, React, Ruby,
          TypeScript, Python, GraphQL, Postgres, and AWS. Whatever the tech
          stack, I bring an ability to learn fast, solve real problems, improve
          engineering efficiency and effectiveness, and support engineers in
          doing the best work of their careers.

          Working With Me

          I‚Äôm approachable, calm under pressure, and passionate about making
          work a place where people can grow and be proud of what they build. I
          encourage healthy debate, value psychological safety, and default to
          kindness.
        </p>
        <p className="text-zinc-200 mt-4">
          My management philosophy is best described as "trust, but verify". By
          default, I trust my team to show up, do their best work, and
          communicate proactively and transparently about the issues in their
          way. As a leader with accountability for my teams' deliverables, I'll
          also perform my due diligence in ensuring we're on track to meet our
          goals, but do so WITHOUT getting in the way or micromanaging tasks.

        <p className="text-zinc-200 mt-4">
          I collaborate respectfully and successfully with Product, Design,
          Data, Marketing, Success/Support, and exec partners to ensure
          Engineering is aligned and driving the business forward. I'm
          comfortable influencing across the org while still rolling up my
          sleeves when needed.
